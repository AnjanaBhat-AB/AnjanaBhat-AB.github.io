<p class="para1" ><br>Hello viewer, I'm Anjana.<br><br>
    My objective is to learn new techniques and skills and working hard to the growth of the company.<br><br>
    I have done a project on Pharmacy Management System that has been developed to overcome the problems prevailing in the practicing manual system.
     This software is supported to eliminate and in some cases reduce the hardships faced by this existing system.
     Moreover this system is designed for the particular need of the company to carry out operations in a smooth and effective manner.<br><br>
     I have done a project on computer graphics and the purpose of this project is to graphically demonstrate the working of a Client Server
     Architecture through a set of OpenGL functions.
     Client-Server Architecture has a client computer and a server computer and in order to
    establish the connection using TCP, three-way handshaking is done between client and
    server. In our project we have also shown the downloading and uploading processes
    between client and server.<br><br>
